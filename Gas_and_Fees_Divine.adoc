## What is Gas? Describe its purpose in Ethereum transactions.
In Ethereum, Gas acts as the internal pricing mechanism for network operations, essentially measuring the computational effort required to execute transactions or smart contract interactions. It's paid in Ether (ETH), often denominated in Gwei (a tiny fraction of ETH), and serves several crucial purposes: Gas incentivizes validators (who secure the network) by rewarding them for processing transactions, prevents network spam by making it costly to flood the blockchain with useless operations, and efficiently allocates computational resources by ensuring users pay proportional to their usage. Furthermore, every transaction has a gas limit to prevent infinite loops and manage resource consumption, while the fluctuating gas price dynamically adjusts based on network congestion, ensuring the system remains functional and responsive even under heavy demand.

## EIP-1559: Explain how it reformed gas fees (base fee, priority fee, burning mechanism).
EIP-1559, implemented in August 2021, significantly reformed Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism from a simple auction system to a more predictable model based on two main components: a base fee and a priority fee. The base fee is an algorithmically determined minimum fee required for a transaction to be included in a block, which dynamically adjusts based on network congestion – increasing when blocks are full and decreasing when they're less utilized – and is burned, meaning it's permanently removed from circulation, making ETH potentially deflationary. Users can also add an optional priority fee (or "tip") to incentivize validators to prioritize their transaction, especially during busy periods, and this fee goes directly to the validator. This new structure aims to make gas fees more predictable for users, reduce overpayments, and introduce a deflationary pressure on ETH supply through the burning mechanism.
## Slippage: Define it and how it relates to gas prices (e.g., in swaps or high-demand blocks).
Slippage is the difference between the expected and actual price of a crypto trade, common in volatile markets like decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It's closely tied to gas prices because when network congestion drives gas costs up, transactions can be delayed in the mempool. During this delay, market prices can shift, causing negative slippage (you get less than expected). In high-demand blocks, multiple transactions can rapidly change prices, leading to slippage for those processed later. While users can set a "slippage tolerance" to limit this, setting it too low during high gas prices can lead to failed transactions, where you still pay gas fees even though the trade didn't complete due to market movement exceeding your tolerance.
